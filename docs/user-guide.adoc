== Introduction

The CGMES DiagramLayout Editor is a specialized web application designed for viewing and editing power system diagram layouts based on the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES). This guide explains how to use the application effectively, including all available interactions and keyboard shortcuts.

== Getting Started

=== Connection Setup

. Enter a valid SPARQL endpoint URL in the "SPARQL Endpoint URL" field
. Select the appropriate CGMES version (2.4.15 or 3.0)
. Click "Load diagram profiles" to query available diagrams
. Select a diagram from the dropdown menu
. Click "Render diagram" to display the diagram on the canvas

[TIP]
The application remembers your last endpoint URL for convenience.

=== Interface Overview

The application interface consists of these main sections:

* *Header*: Title of the application
* *Configuration Panel*: SPARQL endpoint, CGMES version, diagram selection
* *Grid Controls*: Toggle grid visibility, snap-to-grid, and adjust grid size
* *Canvas*: Interactive diagram rendering area
* *Navigation Map*: Miniature diagram view in the lower right corner
* *Status Bar*: Current status and cursor coordinates

== Canvas Interactions

|*Paste Objects*
|Press kbd:[Ctrl+V] to paste previously copied objects at the cursor position

|*Delete Objects*
|Select points and press kbd:[Delete] to remove their parent objects (with confirmation)

|*Rotate Clockwise*
|Select points and press kbd:[Ctrl+Right Arrow] to rotate 90째 clockwise

|*Rotate Counter-clockwise*

== Navigation Map

The navigation map is a miniature representation of the entire diagram that appears in the lower right corner of the canvas.

=== Using the Navigation Map

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Action |Description

|*Toggle Visibility*
|Click the +/- button to show or hide the navigation map

|*Resize Map*
|Drag the resize handle in the bottom-right corner to change the map size

|*View Current Position*
|The red rectangle in the navigation map shows your current view area in the context of the whole diagram

|*Navigate to Location*
|Click anywhere in the navigation map to center the main view on that location

|*Pan Using the Map*
|Click and drag in the navigation map to pan the main view across the diagram
|===

=== Navigation Map Features

* *Show/Hide Toggle*: Use the button above the map to show or hide it as needed
* *Resizable*: Grab the handle in the bottom-right corner to resize the map
* *Complete View*: The map always shows the entire diagram regardless of size 
* *Visual Reference*: Lines and points in the diagram are represented in the map
* *Real-time Updates*: The visible area indicator updates as you pan and zoom in the main canvas

[TIP]
The navigation map is especially useful for very large diagrams where it's easy to lose context of where you are in the overall structure.

== Grid Functions

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Option |Description

|*Show Grid*
|Toggle to display a grid on the canvas background

|*Snap to Grid*
|Toggle to automatically align points to the nearest grid lines when moving

|*Grid Size*
|Adjust the spacing between grid lines
|===

== Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Shortcut |Function

|kbd:[Ctrl] + Click
|Select a point

|kbd:[Ctrl] + Drag
|Select multiple points within a rectangle

|kbd:[Ctrl+C]
|Copy selected diagram objects

|kbd:[Ctrl+V]
|Paste copied objects at cursor position

|kbd:[Delete]
|Delete selected diagram objects

|kbd:[Ctrl+Right Arrow]
|Rotate selected objects 90째 clockwise

|kbd:[Ctrl+Left Arrow]
|Rotate selected objects 90째 counter-clockwise

|kbd:[Esc]
|Close active tooltip
|===

== Point Tooltips

When hovering over a point, a tooltip displays detailed information about the point and its parent diagram object:

* *DiagramObject*: mRID, name, offset, rotation
* *DiagramObjectPoint*: mRID, name, sequence number, x/y/z coordinates

The tooltip provides several interaction options:

* Pin/unpin the tooltip to keep it visible
* Copy values to clipboard by selecting the text
* Close the tooltip with the X button or kbd:[Esc] key

== Technical Details

=== SPARQL Integration

The editor communicates with the SPARQL endpoint in these ways:

* *Loading diagrams*: Queries for all available diagrams
* *Rendering a diagram*: Retrieves all objects and points for the selected diagram
* *Updating positions*: Sends updates when points are moved
* *Adding/removing points*: Creates or deletes point data
* *Toggling polygon property*: Updates object properties

=== Coordinates and Units

* All coordinates in the system are in CGMES world units
* The status bar displays the current cursor position in these units
* Grid settings and measurements use the same coordinate system

== Best Practices

* *Saving your work*: Changes are written to the SPARQL endpoint immediately after editing
* *Complex diagrams*: Use selection rectangle (Ctrl+drag) to select multiple points in dense areas
* *Precision placement*: Enable "Snap to Grid" and adjust grid size for accurate positioning
* *Viewing details*: Pin tooltips when you need to refer to point information while working
* *Navigating large diagrams*: Use the navigation map to maintain context and quickly move to different areas
