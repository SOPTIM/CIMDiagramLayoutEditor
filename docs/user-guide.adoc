== Introduction

The CGMES DiagramLayout Editor is a specialized web application designed for viewing and editing power system diagram layouts based on the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES). This guide explains how to use the application effectively, including all available interactions and keyboard shortcuts.

== Getting Started

=== Connection Setup

. Enter a valid SPARQL endpoint URL in the "SPARQL Endpoint URL" field
. Select the appropriate CGMES version (2.4.15 or 3.0)
. Click "Load diagram profiles" to query available diagrams
. Select a diagram from the dropdown menu
. Click "Render diagram" to display the diagram on the canvas

[TIP]
The application remembers your last endpoint URL for convenience.

=== Interface Overview

The application interface consists of these main sections:

* *Header*: Title of the application
* *Configuration Panel*: SPARQL endpoint, CGMES version, diagram selection
* *Grid Controls*: Toggle grid visibility, snap-to-grid, and adjust grid size
* *Canvas*: Interactive diagram rendering area
* *Navigation Map*: Miniature diagram view in the lower right corner
* *Status Bar*: Current status and cursor coordinates

== Canvas Interactions

=== Moving and Grid Snapping

When moving points in the diagram, there are several behaviors to be aware of:

* *Default Behavior*: Selected points snap to the grid when moved, aligning precisely with grid lines.
* *Grid Snapping*: When enabled (default), points are automatically aligned to the nearest grid line during movement.
* *Temporary Override*: Hold the kbd:[Alt] key while dragging to temporarily disable grid snapping, allowing free movement.
* *Grid Size*: Adjustable in the Grid Controls panel - affects the spacing between grid lines and the snapping positions.
* *Multiple Points*: When moving multiple selected points, they maintain their relative positions while the entire selection snaps to the grid.

[TIP]
You can permanently toggle the snap-to-grid behavior using the checkbox in the Grid Controls panel.

=== Editing Operations

|*Navigate to Location*
|Click anywhere in the navigation map to center the main view on that location

|*Pan Using the Map*
|Click and drag in the navigation map to pan the main view across the diagram
|===

=== Navigation Map Features

* *Show/Hide Toggle*: Use the button above the map to show or hide it as needed
* *Resizable*: Grab the handle in the bottom-right corner to resize the map
* *Complete View*: The map always shows the entire diagram regardless of size 
* *Visual Reference*: Lines and points in the diagram are represented in the map
* *Real-time Updates*: The visible area indicator updates as you pan and zoom in the main canvas

[TIP]
The navigation map is especially useful for very large diagrams where it's easy to lose context of where you are in the overall structure.

== Grid Functions

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Option |Description

|*Show Grid*
|Toggle to display a grid on the canvas background

|*Snap to Grid*
|Toggle to enable/disable automatic alignment of points to the nearest grid lines when moving

|*Grid Size*
|Adjust the spacing between grid lines (smaller values provide finer control)
|===

=== Grid Snapping Controls

The application provides several ways to control grid snapping:

* *Permanent Setting*: Use the "Snap to Grid" checkbox in the Grid Controls panel to enable or disable snapping globally
* *Temporary Override*: Hold the kbd:[Alt] key while dragging to temporarily disable snapping even when it's enabled globally
* *Grid Size Adjustment*: Change the grid size to make snapping more precise (smaller values) or coarser (larger values)

[NOTE]
When moving multiple points, the first selected point will snap to the grid, and all other points will maintain their relative positions to that point.

== Working with Glue Points

=== Understanding Glue Points

Glue points are a CGMES concept that allows points from different diagram objects to be logically connected, even when they're not at the exact same coordinates. This is particularly useful for maintaining the logical structure of a power system diagram while allowing flexibility in its visual layout.

[TIP]
Think of glue points as "logical connectors" between components in the diagram. They ensure that connected components maintain their relationship even as you move them around.

=== Visualizing Glue Points

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Action |Description

|*Show Glue Points*
|Toggle the "Show Glue Points" checkbox in the grid controls panel to display dotted blue lines between connected points

|*Identify Connections*
|When glue points are visible, connected points are linked by dotted blue lines, making it easy to see which components are logically connected
|===

=== Creating and Managing Connections

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Action |Description

|*Create Connection*
|Select exactly two points from different objects, then check the "Connected" checkbox that appears

|*Remove Connection*
|Select two connected points and uncheck the "Connected" checkbox

|*Move Connected Points*
|When dragging a point, all points connected to it via glue points will move together, maintaining their relative positions

|*Delete Connected Objects*
|When deleting objects with glue point connections to other objects, you will be prompted to confirm the operation, as it will break those connections
|===

=== Glue Points and Diagram Operations

Glue point relationships are preserved during these operations:

* *Dragging points*: Connected points move together
* *Copying objects*: When you copy and paste objects, their glue point connections to other copied objects are preserved
* *Rotation*: When rotating objects, their glue point connections are maintained

[IMPORTANT]
====
When deleting an object that has glue point connections to objects that aren't being deleted, those connections will be broken. The application will warn you before proceeding.
====

=== Best Practices for Working with Glue Points

* Use glue points to connect related components in power system diagrams
* The "Show Glue Points" toggle helps visualize the logical structure of your diagram
* When reorganizing a diagram, consider moving groups of connected objects together
* Check for existing connections before deleting objects to avoid breaking logical relationships accidentally

== Technical Details

=== SPARQL Integration

The editor communicates with the SPARQL endpoint in these ways:

* *Loading diagrams*: Queries for all available diagrams
* *Rendering a diagram*: Retrieves all objects and points for the selected diagram
* *Updating positions*: Sends updates when points are moved
* *Adding/removing points*: Creates or deletes point data
* *Toggling polygon property*: Updates object properties

=== Coordinates and Units

* All coordinates in the system are in CGMES world units
* The status bar displays the current cursor position in these units
* Grid settings and measurements use the same coordinate system

== Best Practices

* *Saving your work*: Changes are written to the SPARQL endpoint immediately after editing
* *Complex diagrams*: Use selection rectangle (Ctrl+drag) to select multiple points in dense areas
* *Precision placement*: Enable "Snap to Grid" and adjust grid size for accurate positioning
* *Fine-tuning placement*: Use Alt+drag for precise adjustments when grid snapping is too restrictive
* *Viewing details*: Pin tooltips when you need to refer to point information while working
* *Navigating large diagrams*: Use the navigation map to maintain context and quickly move to different areas
