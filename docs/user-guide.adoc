== Introduction

The CGMES DiagramLayout Editor is a specialized web application designed for viewing and editing power system diagram layouts based on the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES). This guide explains how to use the application effectively, including all available interactions and keyboard shortcuts.

== Getting Started

=== Connection Setup

. Enter a valid SPARQL endpoint URL in the "SPARQL Endpoint URL" field
. Select the appropriate CGMES version (2.4.15 or 3.0)
. Click "Load diagram profiles" to query available diagrams
. Select a diagram from the dropdown menu
. Click "Render diagram" to display the diagram on the canvas

[TIP]
The application remembers your last endpoint URL for convenience.

=== Interface Overview

The application interface consists of these main sections:

* *Header*: Title of the application
* *Configuration Panel*: SPARQL endpoint, CGMES version, diagram selection
* *Grid Controls*: Toggle grid visibility, snap-to-grid, and adjust grid size
* *Canvas*: Interactive diagram rendering area
* *Status Bar*: Current status and cursor coordinates

== Point Tooltips

When hovering over a point, a tooltip displays detailed information about the point and its parent diagram object:

* *DiagramObject*: mRID, name, offset, rotation
* *DiagramObjectPoint*: mRID, name, sequence number, x/y/z coordinates

The tooltip provides several interaction options:

* Pin/unpin the tooltip to keep it visible
* Copy values to clipboard by selecting the text
* Close the tooltip with the X button or kbd:[Esc] key

== Technical Details

=== SPARQL Integration

The editor communicates with the SPARQL endpoint in these ways:

* *Loading diagrams*: Queries for all available diagrams
* *Rendering a diagram*: Retrieves all objects and points for the selected diagram
* *Updating positions*: Sends updates when points are moved
* *Adding/removing points*: Creates or deletes point data
* *Toggling polygon property*: Updates object properties

=== Coordinates and Units

* All coordinates in the system are in CGMES world units
* The status bar displays the current cursor position in these units
* Grid settings and measurements use the same coordinate system

== Best Practices

* *Saving your work*: Changes are written to the SPARQL endpoint immediately after editing
* *Complex diagrams*: Use selection rectangle (Ctrl+drag) to select multiple points in dense areas
* *Precision placement*: Enable "Snap to Grid" and adjust grid size for accurate positioning
* *Viewing details*: Pin tooltips when you need to refer to point information while working
